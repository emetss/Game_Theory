------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unpack the .zip-file into an empty folder. Open "Combined.py" using a suitable Python-IDE like Pycharm. Make sure you have the packages numpy, random and matplotlib.pyplot installed. If so, run the code. Don't worry about RuntimeWarning ;), just relax and wait until the first plot is put out.
